# Semantic Search System

## Overview

This project implements a **Semantic Search System** using **spaCy**, an advanced natural language processing library in Python. The application allows users to perform semantic searches, retrieving relevant results based on the meaning of their queries.

## Features

- **Semantic Search**: Users can input queries, and the system retrieves results that are contextually relevant.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and simple front-end for easy interaction with the tool.
- **Fast and Efficient**: Utilizes spaCyâ€™s powerful NLP capabilities for quick processing.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for backend development.
- **spaCy**: The NLP library for processing and understanding text.
- **Flask**: The web framework used for developing the web application.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Technologies used for the front-end development.
- **Tiiny.host or Azure**: Platforms used for hosting the application.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [Link to your GitHub repository]
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd semantic-search-system
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser and go to**: [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

## Usage

1. Enter your query in the input box.
2. Click on the "Search" button.
3. The system will return relevant results based on the meaning of your query.

## Challenges Faced

- **Understanding spaCy**: Initially, there was a learning curve in understanding how to effectively utilize spaCy for semantic searching.
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring the search results were returned quickly and accurately required several iterations of testing and refining the model.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the capabilities of spaCy in building a semantic search tool. It provides a foundation for further enhancements, such as adding more complex query processing or integrating machine learning models for better accuracy.
